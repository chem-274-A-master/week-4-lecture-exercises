Floored division

Floored, or integer division, is a division operation where
the largest possible integer is returned. For example, using floored division 7 divided by 2 is 3.

Refer to the table under the Python documentation for numerics 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex

Write a function that takes two integers x and y and returns the floored division of x by y.
