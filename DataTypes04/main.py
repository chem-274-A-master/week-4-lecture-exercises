Tuple Exercise

Since tuples are immutable, you can't sort them in the same way you can sort lists. 
Recall that you can sort lists by using list.sort().

You can, however, use a Python built-in function called `sorted` to sort a tuple.

sorted_result = sorted(some_tuple)

The `sorted` function returns a new list containing all items from the original tuple,
arranged from the lowest to highest.

For this task, your overall goal is to find the index of the third lowest value in the original tuple.

1. Use `sorted` on the numbers tuple.
2. Use indexing to retrieve the third lowest value.
3. Use an appropriate tuple method to retrieve the index of the third lowest value in the original tuple.
