The dictionary below has densities (in g/ml) for various hydrocarbons.

Create list called "gases" which contains the names of the substances that are gases.

For the purpose of this exercise, consider a substance to be a gas if its density is less than 0.1 g/mL. 


You should use the dictionary iteration method .items for this exercise
